*** Maintenance discoutinued *** - I personnally switched to scredis https://github.com/Livestream/scredis

Fork of https://github.com/spullara/redis-protocol

Maven repository available (see pom.xml in orange-groupid branch) 

----

A very fast Redis client for the JVM.

Description of each module:

redisgen/
  Scrapes the redis.io/commands page and produce various typed clients and servers, very extensible

util/
  Some common encoding and data structures
client/
  Leverages the protocol module for encoding and decoding. Supports both synchronous
  and asynchronous pipelined requests from the RedisClient. Supports 2.6 commands.
protocol/
  Redis protocol encoder / decoder based on input/outputstreams. This is the
  fastest implementation if blocking i/o is ok for your use case.
benchmark/
  A redis-benchmark clone that uses this Java client for comparison testing.

netty/
  A netty 3.5.X compatible codecs for building Redis clients
netty-client/
  Complete client except for MULTI/EXEC.

netty4/
  A netty 4.0.0.Alpha1 compatible codec for building Redis clients
netty4-server/
  A very high performance in-JVM memory redis server clone

util/
  Some library functions used by both the blocking client and the netty clients

In the experiments branch you can find:
  - finagle
  - vertx
  - NIO bytebuffers
  - HBase Loader
  - and more!

Contributions:
Gaël Bréard: Update netty4 client 
   * partial implementation of netty 4 client (some verbs are missing, need just some more copy-paste)
   * refactoring on Reply inheritance tree
   * fix some issues on message order over intense usage of message pipelining
   * some other minor modifications
